The present study in male rats, using the same procedure, showed that wheel running reduced incubated craving after both 30 and 3 days of abstinence.},

	abstract = {The rise in heroin addiction has heightened the need for novel and effective treatments. Physical exercise has been shown as an effective treatment for stimulant abuse in clinical and pre-clinical research. However, this treatment has not yet been tested on opioid addiction. This study examined the effects of physical activity (wheel running) on heroin-seeking in rats within a reinstatement paradigm (i.e., heroin relapse model).},

	abstract = {Previous work indicated that progesterone (PRO) reduced impulsive choice for cocaine in female but not male rats (Smethells et al. Psychopharmacology 233:2999–3008, 2016).

The present study examined impulsive action for cocaine using PRO in male and female rats trained on a go/no-go task.},
